        <br>
        <p>
            Welcome to our online resource designed to explain the concept

            valuable insights into what constitutes administrative burden, 
            understand its significance, and explore the ways in which social 
            support programs improve our nation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Engage with our interactive map, 
            which offers an inventory of the administrative burdens associated 
            with Medicaid, SNAP, and TANF. Bridge the gap between policy and

        <h1>What is administrative burden?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Administrative burden is the costs associated with applying for, 
            receiving, and participating in government benefits and services
            <a href="javascript:void(0);" data-toggle="tooltip" title="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BurdenReductionStrategies.pdf" class="citation">[1]</a>. 
            They can appear in many ways that can impede individuals' ability 
            to easily access assistance. A complex application process requires 
            individuals to know how to navigate through the application processes 
            for several programs, which can be intricate and overwhelming. 
            Documentation requirements force individuals to dedicate time to 
            collect documents, which may not be easily accessible. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>    
            Additionally, 
            renewal requirements make previously approved applicants repeatedly 
            demonstrate their ongoing eligibility, an unnecessary step if their 
            circumstances have not changed. Some services necessitate an in-person 
            application process, demanding individuals take extra time out of their 
            day for something that could potentially be more conveniently completed 
            online. These examples demonstrate the complex process of receiving 
            essential social services.

        <h1 style="color: var(--lightBlue)">Why do we care about administrative burden?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Administrative burden can reduce the enrollment in essential services, 
            leading to underutilization of social support programs. In addition to
            hurting individuals who might benefit directly from social services, administrative 
            burden can have broader societal effects:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            A <span style="color:var(--yellow)">positive externality</span> 
            is when private demand and supply curves do not accurately 
            measure marginal social benefits. More simply put, it is when there are positive 
            side effects of a program that are not included in the program's price tag. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>For Medicaid, access to healthcare for an individual can reduce the spread of sickness for the community. 
            </li>
            <li>SNAP has been shown to reduce healthcare costs
                <a href="javascript:void(0);" data-toggle="tooltip" title="https://www.cbpp.org/research/snap-is-linked-with-improved-nutritional-outcomes-and-lower-health-care-costs" class="citation">[2]</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                SNAP has been shown to benefit the economy at large. In a weak economy, $1 in SNAP benefits
                 generates $1.50 in economic activity
                 <a href="javascript:void(0);" data-toggle="tooltip" title="https://www.cbpp.org/research/snap-is-linked-with-improved-nutritional-outcomes-and-lower-health-care-costs" class="citation">[3]</a>.

        <br>
        <p>
            A <span style="color:var(--yellow)">negative externality</span>  is when private demand and supply curves do not accurately measure marginal social cost. More simply put, when negative side effects are not included in the costs of the program. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For Medicaid, uninsured individuals with uncompensated care pass costs to other users of the medical system

            </li>
            <li>
                For TANF, every $1 less to families is associated with an $8 cost to society due to an increase in spending for children and parents' health

        <h1>What are the benefits of social support programs?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong style="color: var(--blue)">Redistribution</strong> involves the transfer 
            of resources from one group to another and is often implemented through 
            government intervention such as social support programs, which are designed 
            to shift resources from high-income individuals to those with lower incomes
            <a href="javascript:void(0);" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Gruber, page 55" class="citation">[6]</a>. 
            This process has been recognized for its positive impacts in reducing 
            economic inequality and for fostering policies that prioritize the 
            maximization of social welfare.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>    
            The concept of <strong style="color: var(--blue)">consumption smoothing</strong> 
            relates to the redistribution of 
            consumption from periods of high consumption, where marginal utility is 
            low, to periods when consumption is less and marginal utility is higher
            <a href="javascript:void(0);" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Gruber, page 415" class="citation">[7]</a>. 
            This is the idea that individuals have a preference for consistent levels 
            of consumption over time, avoiding fluctuations between extremes that can 
            disrupt an individual's standard of living. Programs such as Medicaid, 
            TANF, and SNAP are designed with a consumption smoothing model in mind, 
            particularly for low-income individuals. For instance, a low-income 
            individual with access to Medicaid is able to receive healthcare services 
            on a regular basis, stabilizing their healthcare consumption. Without 
            such support, the individual would likely face periods of reduced healthcare 
            consumption, deviating from the ideal of consumption smoothing.

          Medicaid is a health care program that is federally mandated but 
          state run for low-income families and low-income disabled and elderly
          <a href="javascript:void(0);" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Gruber, page 562" class="citation">[1]</a>. 
          Eligibility is determined based on income and family structure. 
          The program is federally funded through matching grants, and there 
          are federal mandates for minimum eligibility and service coverage. 
          States are permitted to administer their programs to increase eligibility 
          and increase coverage, so there is a wide variation in Medicaid design

          Medicaid is the single largest source of health coverage in the United

           The program is jointly funded through federal 
          block grants and state maintenance of effort contributions. There are 
          federal mandates for time restrictions and work requirements. States are 
          permitted to design their own programs, so there is a wide variation in what 
          type of support and amount of support provided. An estimated 2.8 million 
          people receive assistance in 2023

          SNAP is an in-kind program that provides nutritional support for low-income 
          individuals. Eligibility is determined by state cash welfare programs like 
          TANF or by monthly cash income
          <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Gruber, page 612" class="citation">[1]</a>. 
          The program is federally funded but administered

          The federal government sets eligibility limits and benefit levels, 
          so there is little variation between states. States do design the application 
          process with federal guidelines, so there is variation in the application
          <a href="javascript:void(0);" data-toggle="tooltip" title=" https://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-the-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap" class="citation">[3]</a>. 
          SNAP is the largest anti-hunger program with an estimated 38 million recipients
