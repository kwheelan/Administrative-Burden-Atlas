        <br>
        <p>
            Administrative burden is the costs associated with applying for, 
            receiving, and participating in government benefits and services
            <a href="javascript:void(0);" data-toggle="tooltip" title="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BurdenReductionStrategies.pdf" class="citation">[1]</a>. 
            They can appear in many ways that can impede individuals' ability 
            to easily access assistance. A complex application process requires 
            individuals to know how to navigate the application processes 
            for several programs, which can be intricate and overwhelming. 
            Documentation requirements force individuals to dedicate time to 
            collect documents, which may not be easily accessible.

            Additionally, 
            renewal requirements make previously approved applicants repeatedly 
            demonstrate their ongoing eligibility, an unnecessary step if their 
            circumstances have not changed. Some services necessitate an in-person 
            application process, demanding individuals take extra time out of their 
            day for something that could potentially be more conveniently completed 
            online.

        <h1>Why do we care about administrative burden?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Administrative burden can reduce the enrollment in essential services, 
            leading to underutilization of social support programs. In addition to
            hurting individuals who might benefit directly from social services, administrative 
            burden can have broader societal effects:

        <p>
            A <strong>positive externality</strong> 
            is when private demand and supply curves do not accurately 
            measure marginal social benefits. More simply put, it is when there are positive 
            side effects of a program that are not included in the program's price tag.

            <li>For Medicaid, access to healthcare for an individual can reduce the spread of sickness for the community.

            <li>SNAP has been shown to reduce healthcare costs

            </li>
            <li>
                SNAP has been shown to benefit the economy at large. In a weak economy, $1 in SNAP benefits
                 generates $1.50 in economic activity

            A <strong>negative externality</strong>  is when private demand and supply curves do not accurately measure marginal social cost. More simply put, it is when negative side effects are not included in the costs of the program.

        <h1>What are the benefits of social support programs?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Redistribution</strong> involves the transfer 
            of resources from one group to another and is often implemented through 
            government intervention such as social support programs, which are designed 
            to shift resources from high-income individuals to those with lower incomes
            <a href="javascript:void(0);" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Gruber, page 55" class="citation">[6]</a>. 
            This process can help reduce economic inequality and maximize social welfare.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>    
            The concept of <strong>consumption smoothing</strong> 
            relates to the redistribution of 
            consumption from periods of high consumption, where marginal utility is 
            low, to periods when consumption is less and marginal utility is higher
            <a href="javascript:void(0);" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Gruber, page 415" class="citation">[7]</a>. 
            This is the idea that individuals have a preference for consistent levels 
            of consumption (spending) over time, avoiding fluctuations between extremes that can 
            disrupt an individual's standard of living. Programs such as Medicaid, 
            TANF, and SNAP are designed with a consumption smoothing model in mind, 
            particularly for low-income individuals. For instance, a low-income 
            individual with access to Medicaid is able to receive healthcare services 
            on a regular basis, stabilizing their healthcare consumption. Without 
            such support, the individual would likely face periods of reduced healthcare 
            consumption, deviating from the ideal of consumption smoothing.
